# 30-day-n8n-plan
A practical, beginner-friendly roadmap to learn n8n in 30 days. Each day delivers:
- A focused topic
- A short, copy-pasteable README
- An import-ready workflow JSON
- Clear testing steps (Postman and/or curl)

> Audience: First-time n8n users and non-technical readers. Every action includes explicit steps with `+` and `→` indicators.

---

## Goals

- Build a strong foundation for n8n: triggers, logic, HTTP, scheduling, and integrations.
- Learn by doing: every day ships a tiny, testable workflow.
- Keep it reproducible and sharable: all content is copy-pasteable.
